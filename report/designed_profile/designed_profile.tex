\section{First Principal}
The scalar radiative transfer integro-differential equation is conventionaly
written as below
\footnote{It should be noticed that here we denote the earth surface as $z = 0$, 
and the top of atmosphere (TOA) as $z = z^{*}$}
:  
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:firstprincipal}
-\mu \frac{\ud L(z; \mu, \phi)}{k \ud z} & = & 
L(z; \mu, \phi) - J(z; \mu, \phi) \qquad \textrm{(upward)} \nonumber\\
\mu \frac{\ud L(z; -\mu, \phi)}{k \ud z} & = & 
L(z; -\mu, \phi) - J(z; -\mu, \phi) \qquad \textrm{(downward)}
\end{eqnarray}

\oops{where}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sourceterm1}
    J(z; \mu, \phi) = 
    \frac{\omega_{0}}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\!\!\int_{-1}^{1}
    P(\mu, \phi, \mu', \phi')L(z;\mu',\phi')\ud\mu'\ud\phi'
    + (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z))
\end{equation}
is called source term

\section{Simplification for microwave ratiation tranfer}
\subsection{Angular independency of radiance}
Since the source of microwave radiation is far less anisotropic than solar radiation,
the radiance of microwave radiation is usually treated with no angular denpendency:
the phase function $P(\mu,\phi,\mu',\phi')$ is then reduced to $P(\mu,\mu')$
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:angularindependency}
    L(z;\mu,\phi) & = & L(z,\mu) \nonumber\\
    J(z;\mu,\phi) & = & J(z,\mu) \nonumber\\
    P(\mu,\phi,\mu',\phi') & = & \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}P(\mu,\mu')\ud\phi'
\end{eqnarray}
Insert (\ref{eq:angularindependency}) into (\ref{eq:firstprincipal}), we get:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:firstprincipal2}
\mp\mu \frac{\ud L(z, \pm\mu)}{k \ud z} & = & 
L(z, \pm\mu) - J(z, \pm\mu) \nonumber\\
J(z, \pm\mu) & = &
\frac{\omega_{0}}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}
P(\mu, \pm\mu')L(z,\pm\mu')\ud\mu'
+ (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z))
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{First Order Spherical Harmonic Method (SHM)}
\subsubsection{Equations}
the first order spherical harmonic method applied in RTTOV-SCATT
is derived from two first order approximations:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:SHMapprox}
L(z,\mu) & = & P_{0}(\mu)L_{0}(z) + P_{1}(\mu)L_{1}(z) 
 =  L_{0}(z) + \mu L_{1}(z) \nonumber\\
P(\cos\Theta) & = & P_{0}(\cos\Theta)P_{0} + P_{1}(\cos\Theta)P_{1}
 =  1 + 3g\cos\Theta
\end{eqnarray}

The scattering angle $\Theta$ can be expressed below:
\begin{displaymath}
    \cos\Theta = \mu\mu' + \sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}\sqrt{1-\mu'^{2}}cos(\phi - \phi')
\end{displaymath}

If plugged into (\ref{eq:angularindependency}), we get the phase function expressed
as first order spherical harmonic expantion:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pmumup}
    P(\mu,\mu') = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}
    \big(
        1 + 3g(\mu\mu' + \sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}\sqrt{1-\mu'^{2}}cos(\phi - \phi'))
    \big)
        \ud\phi'
    = 1 + 3g\mu\mu'
\end{equation}

Then we can express the source term by first order spherical harmonic expansion:
\begin{eqnarray}
J(z,\mu) & = & \frac{\omega_{0}}{2}
\int_{-1}^{1}P(\mu, \mu')L(z, \mu')\ud\mu'
+ (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z))  \nonumber\\
{} & = &  \frac{\omega_{0}}{2}
\int_{-1}^{1}(1+3g\mu\mu')(L_{0}(z) + \mu L_{1}(z))\ud\mu'
+ (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z)))  \nonumber\\
{} & = &  \omega_{0}(g \mu L_{1}(z) + L_{0}(z))
+ (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z))
\end{eqnarray}

Now we finally get the RTM equation in first order SHM approximation 
\begin{equation}
    \mp \mu \frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z} - \mu^{2} \frac{\ud L_{1}(z)}{\ud z}
    = L_{0}(z) \pm \mu L_{1}(z) 
    - \omega_{0}(\pm g \mu L_{1}(z) + L_{0}(z))
    - (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z))
\end{equation}

As for the first order SHM method, here we use the first two moment equation straightforward 
instead of the recursive relation of legendre function:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \int_{-1}^{1}\mp \mu \frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z} - \mu^{2} \frac{\ud L_{1}(z)}{\ud z} \ud \mu
    & = & \int_{-1}^{1}
    \big(
        L_{0}(z) \pm \mu L_{1}(z) 
    - \omega_{0}(\pm g \mu L_{1}(z) + L_{0}(z))
    - (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z)) 
    \big) \ud \mu \nonumber\\
    \int_{-1}^{1}\mp \mu^{2} \frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z} - \mu^{3} \frac{\ud L_{1}(z)}{\ud z} \ud \mu
    & = & \int_{-1}^{1}
    \big(
        \mu L_{0}(z) \pm \mu^{2} L_{1}(z) 
    - \omega_{0}(\pm g \mu^{2} L_{1}(z) + \mu L_{0}(z))
    - (1-\omega_{0})B(T(z)) \mu 
    \big) \ud \mu \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Regardless of the sign of $\mu$(i.e., upward or downward), 
we do simplification to the above moment equations and always get the following group
of equation:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:ODEs}
    \frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z} & = & -k(z)(1-\omega_{0}(z)g(z))L_{1}(z) \nonumber\\
    \frac{\ud L_{1}(z)}{\ud z} & = & -3k(z)(1-\omega_{0}(z)(L_{0}(z) - B(T(z)))
\end{eqnarray}

Eliminate $L_{1}$ we get the two order ODE

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ODE}
    \frac{\ud^{2}L_{0}(z)}{\ud z ^{2}} = \Lambda(z)^{2}(L_{0}(z) - B(T(z)))
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lamda}
    \Lambda(z)^{2} = 3k(z)^{2}(1-\omega_{0}(z)g(z))(1-\omega_{0}(z))
\end{equation}

Equations (\ref{eq:ODE}) and (\ref{eq:Lamda}) is a 
two-order inhomogeneous ordinate differential equation 
with inconstant coefficients, to solve the ODE numerically, 
we cut the interval into layers, and take the approximation that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The bulk scattering properties such as $k(z), \omega_{0}(z) \textrm{ and } g(z)$
is constant in every single layer
\item The planck function $B(T(z))$ is a linear function of height z in each layer:
(i.e., $B(T(z)) = B_{0} + B_{1}z) $\footnote{Here z denote the height in layer rather than height from earth surface}
\end{enumerate}
With the above assumptions, the question is reduced to a group of 
two-order ODEs with constant coefficients, and a group of join conditions
derived at the boundary of layers(see section boundary conditions).
Then the ODE can be solved analytically in each layer:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:analsolul0}
    L_{0}(z) = D_{+}e^{\Lambda z} + D_{-}e^{ - \Lambda z} + B_{0} + B_{1}z
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:analsolul1}
    L_{1}(z) = \frac{-1}{k(1-\omega_{0}g)}\frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z} 
    = -\frac{3}{2h} \frac{\ud L_{0}(z)}{\ud z}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:h}
    h = 1.5k(1-\omega_{0}g)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Boundary Conditions and Join Conditions}
To derive the boundary conditions and join conditions in the boundary of 
thin layers, we take a different perspective from the spherical moment method in SHM above,
but look at the question in a more phisical way: we care more about the flux density of the radation 
at the layer boundaries. They must be continuous at the boundary.


\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:fluxdensity} 
    F(z)_{\uparrow}\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{i} & = & F(z)_{\uparrow}\Big|_{z_{top}}^{i+1} \qquad (i=1,2,\ldots,n-1) \nonumber\\
    F(z)_{\downarrow}\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{i} & = & F(z)_{\downarrow}\Big|_{z_{top}}^{i+1} \qquad (i=1,2,\ldots,n-1) \nonumber\\
    F(z)_{\downarrow}\Big|_{z_{top}}^{n} & = & \pi B(T_{cosmos}) \nonumber\\
    F(z)_{\uparrow}\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{1} & = & \overline{\epsilon_{sfc}} \pi B(T_{sfc}) 
    + (1-\overline{\epsilon_{sfc}}) F(z)_{\downarrow}\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{1}  
\end{eqnarray} \footnote{Now, say we cut the profile into n layers, and the layer number increase from surface to cosmos}

Where,
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:epsilonbar}
    \overline{\epsilon_{sfc}} & = & 2\int_{0}^{1}\epsilon_{sfc}\mu \ud \mu \nonumber\\
    F(z)_{\uparrow}\Big|_{z_{top/bot}}^{i} & = & \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1}(L_{0} + \mu L_{1})\mu\ud\mu\ud\phi \nonumber\\
    {} & = & 2\pi\int_{0}^{1}(L_{0}+ \mu L{1})\mu = \pi (L_{0} - \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{top/bot}}^{i} \nonumber\\
    F(z)_{\downarrow}\Big|_{z_{top/bot}}^{i} & = & \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{-1}^{0}(L_{0} + \mu L_{1})\mu\ud\mu\ud\phi \nonumber\\
    {} & = & \pi (L_{0} + \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{top/bot}}^{i}
\end{eqnarray}

Hence,
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:boundarycondition} 
    (L_{0} - \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{i} & = & (L_{0} - \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{top}}^{i+1} \qquad (i=1,2,\ldots,n-1) \nonumber\\
    (L_{0} + \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{i} & = & (L_{0} + \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{top}}^{i+1} \qquad (i=1,2,\ldots,n-1) \nonumber\\
    (L_{0} + \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{top}}^{1} & = & B(T_{cosmos}) \nonumber\\
    (L_{0} - \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{n} & = & \overline{\epsilon_{sfc}} B(T_{sfc}) 
    + (1-\overline{\epsilon_{sfc}}) (L_{0} + \frac{\ud L_{0}}{h \ud z})\Big|_{z_{bot}}^{n}  
\end{eqnarray}

Boundary conditions numbers in (\ref{eq:boundarycondition}) add up to 2n, 
thus the group of two order ODE with constant coefficients is well-posed.
That is to say, the question fianlly boil down to solving a group of linear algebra equations, 
whose unknowns are $D_{+}^{i}, D_{-}^{i}(i=1, 2, \ldots, n)$.
It is worth noticing that the coefficients matrix of the boundary condition linear algebra equation
is a band matrix with band width = 4, which can be solved efficiently with LAPACK routine \oops{DGBTRS} and \oops{DGBTRF}.

\subsection{Integrate Source Term}

At the moment, say we have determined the Integrate constant $D_{+}^{i}, D_{-}^{i}(i=1, 2, \ldots, n)$.
Of course, the top of atmosphere radiance (TOA) viewed at any zenith angle $\mu$ can be get simply from
$L(z^{*}, \mu) = L_{0}(z^{*}) + \mu L_{1}(z^{*})$.

However, it must sounds not surprising that such a method is far from precise, since SHM is approximation method
especially in calculating light propogation along a specified ray track. Though it may show good performance
in estimate flux density in solving boundary conditions, since it is a spherical moment method.
\footnote{further comparison between the result given by straight forward and 
integrate source term will be presented in the appendix.}

To derive the integrate source method, we have to start from first principal.
Take the downward equation for instance: 

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:downwardeq}
    \mu \frac{\ud L(z, -\mu)}{k \ud z} & = & 
    L(z, -\mu) - J(z, -\mu)
\end{eqnarray}

We do variable seperation and 
integrate (\ref{eq:downwardeq}) it from $\Delta z(z_{top})$ to $0 (z_{bot})$ 

\begin{displaymath}
\int_{\Delta z}^{0} \Big(
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}} \ud L(z, -\mu) - \frac{k}{\mu}e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}}L(z, -\mu)\ud z
    \Big) = 
\int_{\Delta z}^{0}\ud\Big(
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}}L(z, -\mu)
    \Big) = 
-\int_{\Delta z}^{0}
    \frac{k}{\mu}e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}}J(z, -\mu)\ud z
\end{displaymath}

Hence,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:integratesource}
    L(0, -\mu) = e^{-\frac{kk\Delta z}{\mu}}L(\Delta z, -\mu) + \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}}J(z, -\mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu}
\end{equation}

conventionaly, we call $(1 - e^{-\frac{kz}{\mu}})L(\Delta z, -\mu)$ the \oops{extinction loss
term} in that thin layer, and denote the optical depth by the following expression:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tau}
    \tau = e^{-\frac{k\Delta z}{\mu}}
\end{equation}

And more, we call the second term on the right hand of (\ref{eq:integratesource}) the \oops{source term} in
in that thin layer: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:jdo}
    J_{downward} = \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}z}J(z, -\mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu}
\end{equation}

Thus,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:simplified}
    L(z_{bot}, \mu) = \tau L(z_{top}, \mu) + J_{downward} 
    = L(z_{top}, \mu) - L_{extloss} + J_{downward}  
\end{equation}

Likewise, we have

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:integratesource2}
    L(\Delta z, \mu) & = & e^{-\frac{k\Delta z}{\mu}}L(0, \mu) + \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}(\Delta z - z)}J(z, \mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu} \qquad \textrm{(upward)}  \nonumber\\
    L(0, -\mu) & = & e^{-\frac{k\Delta z}{\mu}}L(\Delta z, -\mu) + \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}z}J(z, -\mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu} \qquad \textrm{(downward)}
\end{eqnarray}

with

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:jspecify}
    J_{downward} & = & \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu(\Delta z - z)}}J(z, -\mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu} \nonumber \\
    J_{upward} & = & \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}z}J(z, -\mu)\frac{k\ud z}{\mu}
\end{eqnarray}

We just need to get $J_{downward}$ and $J_{upward}$ by doing the integration,
for instance:

\begin{displaymath} 
    J_{upward} = \int_{0}^{\Delta z}
    e^{-\frac{k}{\mu}(\Delta z - z)}
    \Big(
        (1-\omega_{0})(B_{0}+B_{1}z) + \omega_{0}(L_{0}(z) + g\mu L_{1}(z)
    \Big)
    \frac{k\ud z}{\mu}
\end{displaymath}


All the preparation have been done, now we can write the source integration over
the track of light as:


\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:sequential}
    L(z_{top}^{1}, -\mu) & = & B(T_{cosmos}) \nonumber\\
    L(z_{top}^{i+1}/z_{bot}^{i}, -\mu) & = & \tau^{i}L(z_{top}^{i}, -\mu) + J_{down}^{i}(-\mu) 
    \qquad (i=1,2, \ldots, n-1) \nonumber\\
    L(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, \mu) & = & \overline{\epsilon_{sfc}}B(T_{sfc}) 
    + (1-\overline{\epsilon_{sfc}})L(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, -\mu) \nonumber\\
    L(z_{bot}^{i}/z_{top}^{i+1}, \mu) & = & \tau^{i+1}L(z_{bot}^{i+1}, \mu) + J_{up}^{i+1}(\mu) 
    \qquad (i=1,2, \ldots, n-1) \nonumber\\
    L(z^{*}, \mu) & = & L(z_{top}^{1})
\end{eqnarray}

Equivalently, or, we can track the light in two path:

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item path 1: cosmos - surface - TOA
    \begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:path1rad}
        L(z_{top}^{1}, -\mu) & = & B(T_{cosmos}) \nonumber\\
        L(z_{top}^{i+1}/z_{bot}^{i}, -\mu) & = & \tau^{i}L(z_{top}^{i}, -\mu) + J_{down}^{i}(-\mu) 
        \qquad (i=1,2, \ldots, n-1) \nonumber\\
        L_{path1}(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, \mu) & = & (1-\overline{\epsilon_{sfc}})L(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, -\mu) \nonumber\\
        L_{path1}(z^{*}, \mu) & = & \tau^{*}L(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, \mu)
    \end{eqnarray} 
    where,
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:tau*}
        \tau^{*} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\tau^{i}
    \end{equation}
    \item path 2: surface - TOA
\end{enumerate}
    \begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:path2rad}
        L_{path2}(z_{sfc}/z_{bot}^{n}, \mu) & = & \overline{\epsilon_{sfc}}B(T_{sfc}) \nonumber\\
        L_{path2}(z_{bot}^{i}/z_{top}^{i+1}, \mu) & = & \tau^{i+1}L_{path2}(z_{bot}^{i+1}, \mu) + J_{up}^{i+1}(\mu) 
        \qquad (i=1,2, \ldots, n-1) \nonumber\\
        L_{path2}(z^{*}, \mu) & = & L_{path2}(z_{top}^{1})
    \end{eqnarray}

Such a way speed up the numerical calculation, and make the analysis of light propogation convenient:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:path1 and path2}
    L(z^{*}, \mu) = L_{path1}(z^{*}, \mu) + L_{path2}(z^{*}, \mu)
\end{equation}

\chapter{Experiment On Designed Profile}

\section{Profile Design Philosophy}
It deserves a lot labour to explain on the motivation to do the profile design experiment,
so as the philosophy of our profile design. Modern numerical weather prediction models still show
poor performance in reproducing the cloud system of convective precipitation events. 
Nevertheless, we have to take a first step in hydrometeor estimation for all-sky assimilation.

Our experiment on designed profile is based on the belief that influence of the vertical inhomogeneity 
of ice particle habit on simulated brightness temperature is nonlinear. By nonlinear, we mean that 
the hydrometeor profile (i.e., the vertical structure of the cloud), is coupled with the vertical inhomogeneity 
of ice particle haibit to dominate the radiative transfer process within the cloud, in a nonlinear way.

Naturally, it comes up to our mind we can design a cloud structure also with two degree of freedom (i.e., 
the low habit layer and high habit layer adjusting factor), to multiply with the mixing ratio profile of
ice hydrometeors and control the cloud structure quantitatively.

To be more specific, we set the standard profile as the eyewall profile of typhoon Feiyan 
simulated by GRAPES model (Fig. \ref{fig:stdprofile}) and set the grid of low and high habit layer factors 
as an array logarithmically evenly spaced between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{1}$ with 40 grids.



\begin{figure}[hb]

\caption{This figure show the average hydrometeor profile of 
tropical cyclone Feiyan's eyewall, simulated by GRAPES RMFS (10km operational run 2018083100z +3h).
By eyewall, we mean all the profiles that is 35 to 45km away from the storm center.
325hPa is the boundary line of ice particle habit in this experiment}
\label{fig:stdprofile}
\end{figure}

In this research, we get equally interested with the simulated final brightness temperature observarable by satellite,
and also the intermediate radiave tranfer variables like upward and downward \oops{radiance}, \oops{extinction loss} and
\oops{source term} in each RTTOV-SCATT layer (\oops{extinction loss} and \oops{source term}) and at its boundaries (\oops{radiance}), 
as mentioned in (\ref{eq:integratesource}).

\begin{figure}[hb]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./pdf/plotBTexample.pdf}
\caption{This figure show the brightness temperature of four vertical inhomogeneity schemes under various cloud vertical 
structure conditions, quantitatively controled by two factors: low habit layer and high habit layer adjusting factor,

profile as (Fig. \ref{fig:stdprofile}). The zenith of instrument viewing angle is fixed at 60 deg.

The solid and dotted line in the chart represent the upward or downward rediance 
of different vertical inhomogeneity schemes of ice particle shapes, so with the extinction loss (denoted by solid or hollow circles)
and source term (denoted by solid or hatched bars).
We use solid (positive contribution to radiance) or dashed (negative contribution to radiance) black line segement 
to connect the top of source term bar and the extinction circle, representing the net contribution to radiance in that
RTTOV-SCATT layer. 
Please review (\ref{eq:path1rad} and \ref{eq:path2rad}) to get the exact definition of upward and downward radiance. 
Here we use the channel 89.0GHZ H of instrument MWRI as example, with both high and low cloud structure
adjusting factor as 1. Again, the zenith of instrument viewing angle is set at 60 deg. 
Simulated by RTTOV-SCATT.}
\label{fig:exrad}
\end{figure}

When we look into the intermediate radiation varaibles plotted in (Fig. \ref{fig:exrad}), we find out that the 
downward radiance vary violently from one vertical inhomogeneity schemes to another within one ice-phase layers, but convergent to 
the same value after going through the water-phase layers in the bottom of atmosphere, making the $L_{path1}(z^{*}, \mu)$ radiance 
become insensitive to vertical inhomogeneity schemes. In fact, the eyewall profile always has total transmission $\tau^{*} < 10^{-3}$, 
and that stays true among all the channels from atmosphere windows to the absorption peak of vapour or oxygen, except for 
two low frequency channels: 10.65GHZ and 18.7GHZ of MWRI, which is insensitive to ice pariticle shape. 
So the downward radiance can be neglected when analysing the intermediate radiation varaibles that makes contribution 
to the observarable brightness temperature.

On the other hand, The upward radiance show a different pattern. The radiance stays the same when radiation goes through the water-phase
layers, and begin to diverge significantly when entering the ice-phase layers, since both extinction loss and source term have a big
dynamic range for different vertical inhomogeneity schemes. However, extinction loss and source term vanish in the layers above 125hPa, 
as hydrometeors fade away at tropopause. The conclusion stays true except for the channels set at absorption peak of vapour or oxygen.

Thus, for our exploration of nonlinear radiative transfer process with ice-phase layers, we should focus on the layers between
125hPa and 550hPa, and we zoom in the figure (Fig. \ref{fig:exrad}) to that range in the follwing part of this report.

\section{Exploration of Radiative Transfer Process}

In this section, let us make some insight into the radiative transfer process within the ice-phase layers for 
different vertical inhomogeneity schemes of ice particle shapes.

\subsection{MWRI}
For instrument MWRI, all the channels are set at atmospheric windows.

\subsubsection{10.65GHZ}
For the lowest frequency channel of MWRI, Ice-phase layers give low extinction loss to the radiation and thus different vertical inhomogeneity
schemes make little difference to observarable BT(see Fig. \ref{fig:MWRI1BT}). Its interested target is the large rain drops in low latitude layers.

It is worth noticing that for the little difference shown in high factor region for ice phase layers, the shape of low layer ice particles
make more difference than high layer shape. It is also illustrated by Fig. \ref{fig:MWRI1rad} \subref{subfig:MWRI1zi44}.
From Fig. \ref{fig:MWRI1rad} \subref{subfig:MWRI1zi44}, we also notice that the low-layer-shape-dominate phenomenon is mainly 
caused by the fact that snow pariticles show a sharp decrease above 275hPa (see Fig. \ref{fig:stdprofile}) and low frequency channels are sensitive to large particles
like snowflakes rather than ice crystals in cloud.
